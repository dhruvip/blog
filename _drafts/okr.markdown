    - WHY (the motivation and the main objective behind it)
        - inspirational
        - significant
        - concrete
        - action oriented
    - WHAT (the Objective in OKR )
    - HOW (the KR in OKR ) : these should be measurable
        - specific and time bound
        - aggressive yet realistic
        - measurable and verifiable
    - Common reasons why they fail :
        - the WHAT part is sometimes impossible
        - lack of clear definition
        - no follow up
        - too many goals overwhelm
        - resources in a team are not aligned

    - Dr Andy Grove's OKR hygiene:
        - okr culture or how okr are set should be " ruthless intellectual honesty, a disregard for self-interest, deep allegiance to the team/cumulative goal"
        - *Less is more* a few selected well chosen objectives imparts a clear message about what is priority, what we say yes to. It helps to keep track of what matters the most
        - Dare to fail. "Output will tend to be greater when everyone strives for a level of achievement beyond their immediate grasp". Stretched goals
        - Be Patient; be resolute. Every process requires a trial and error
        - It almost doesnt matter what you know... To claim that knowledge was secondary and execution all-important
        - "Without rigor, nothing works; yields plummet, chips fail"
    - Intel's Operation Crush:
        - This was a time when intel got competition from Motorola for 8086 microprocessor, and they had to turn around the sales number to get the number one position back
        - this happened in just the span of 6months and with OKRs. 
        - They succeeded
        - In a crisis you need a system that can drive transformation - quickly
    - OKRsuperpower#1 :Focus and commit to priorities

    - **Bono**
        - "I need a process of discipline to keep me from trying to do everything"
    - **Lumeris Story**
        - need right culture to absorb the OKRs
        - once it takes root, okr will help sustain and deepen that culture
    - **Culture/ Attitude**:
        - Culture eats strategies for breakfast
