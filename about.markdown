Hi my name is Dhruvi and you are welcome to the personal vomit ground for my thoughts, experiences and projects.<br />
A normal next-door curious person, with a knack of technology and number.<br />
I am an INFP, with an interest in psychology and history. I like knowing why things are, the way they are. <br />
I laugh at my own jokes.<br />
I read. (too much)<br />
And Satire is my favourite brand of jeans.<br />
