Not sure if you are th kind of person who always felt that you are not at your 100%

Well I have, always </br >
I have so much I want to, but I get to doing not a single one of them</br >
Its not like I dont know the reason for that as well, the obvious and omnipresent ones.</br >
I look at my peers moving forward at a consistant rate and feel my insides burning; /" That should have been me. Why am I also not there /"</br >
That burning desire pushes me to start something new
I make a plan</br >
A detailed and with gantt charts for timelines.</br >
I decide I will do it religiously</br >
</br >
I start executing my plan. I do it for 1-day, 2-day, 1-week, 10-days ...</br >
I loose that motivation</br >
Cannot find it even if I go back to that same LinkedIn update post from my peer</br >
</br >
That half-executed plan will stays that way</br >
Always and forever</br >
</br >
</br >
Qualities I want to have in me:</br >
- Self Discipline</br >
- Focus</br >
- Productivity</br >

I think those 3 are very common problems and I believe they are the qualities one can build on if you are not born with.</br > 
Lucky are those people, who are discipled enough to see their goal through, till the end.</br >

So I have decided to take the matter in my own hands</br >
I want to have these qualities, because I firmly believe that to be successful, that sheer single-minded determination and discipline is needed.</br >

How I will be doing that you ask?</br >
Well, for starters I was lucky enough to know how to Google search. Which I eventually did. </br >
I searched for "how to manage myself"</br >
Because ultimately this was a management issue ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</br >
(What with you having so much potential, and it not getting used wisely!)</br >


So, Dear Readers,</br >
Let me tell you this.</br >
I had no specific objective when I created this blog, but I knew I want to start jotting down everything. From what I read to what I learn , how I learnt, and what I feel. </br >
In a sense I believe its liberating</br >
And cloud providing you a storage where you can refer your experience and notes whenever you wan tis a plus.</br >

Thank you for reading by ramblings
