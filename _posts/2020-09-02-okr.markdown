**OKRs**
- John Doerr

- WHY (the motivation and the main objective behind it)
    - inspirational
    - significant
    - concrete
    - action oriented
- WHAT (the Objective in OKR )
- HOW (the KR in OKR ) : these should be measurable
    - specific and time bound
    - aggressive yet realistic
    - measurable and verifiable
- Common reasons why they fail :
    - the WHAT part is sometimes impossible
    - lack of clear definition
    - no follow up
    - too many goals overwhelm
    - resources in a team are not aligned
